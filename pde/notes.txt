The Belousov-Zhabotinsky Reaction

(i) If the cell is healthy (i.e., in state 0) then its new state is [a/k1] + [b/k2], where a is the number of infected cells among its eight neighbors, b is the number of ill cells among its neighbors, and k1 and k2 are constants. Here "[]" means the integer part of the number enclosed, so that, for example, [7/3] = [2+1/3] = 2.

(ii) If the cell is ill (i.e., in state n) then it miraculously becomes healthy (i.e., its state becomes 0).

(iii) If the cell is infected (i.e., in a state other than 0 and n) then its new state is [s/(a+b+1)] + g, where a and b are as above, s is the sum of the states of the cell and of its neighbors and g is a constant.

================================================================================

(i) Select an integer q in the range 2 through 255. Cells may be in any of the states 1 through q.


(ii) Select two integers k1 and k2 in the range 1 through 8 and an integer g in the range 0 through 100.

(iii) In the transition from one "step" to the next the state of each cell is changed once according to rules (iv) - (vii) below:

(iv) A cell in state q changes to state 1.

(v) A cell in state 1 changes to state a/k1 + b/k2 + 1 where a is the number of neighbors of the cell which are in states 2 through q-1 and b is the number of neighbors in state q.

(vi) A cell in any of states 2 through q-1 changes to S/(9 - c) + g, where S is the sum of the states of the cell and its neighbors and c is the number of neighbors in state 1.

(vii) If the application of rule (v) or rule (vi) would result in a cell having a state > q then the state of that cell becomes q.
