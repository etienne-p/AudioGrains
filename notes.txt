1 buffer = n * automata state (n = 2 * int || 1 / 2 * int)
audio engine requests automata updates
graphics engine draw current auotmata state on screen, in case in changed
(automata refresh rate is independant from animation rate)

audio engine can tell automata: "i expect 2048 samples per update"

bufLen / rate = grainLength

automata:
  n audioGen
    owning n cells
      to compute a grain

grain uses an oscillator and a gain
how do we modulate pitch and gain ?
